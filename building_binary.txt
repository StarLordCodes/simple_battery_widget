1. pip install pyinstaller => to build the binary

2. pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole your_script_name.py  => noconsole is needed because otherwise,
windows will open a console along with the binary

3. pyinstaller will create a spec file, a build directory with some temp files for building, 
and a dist directory which will have the built binary. (got around 37mb file as exe)

4. pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --strip --upx-dir="path to upx.exe" script_name.py => using
a compressor called upx and also using strip flag to remove debug info , but still got an exe around 28mb.
